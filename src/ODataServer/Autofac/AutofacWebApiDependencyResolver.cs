// REVIEW: This code was pulled from the autofac distribution, instead of referencing Autofac.Integration.WebApi, due to error:
// System.TypeLoadException: Inheritance security rules violated while overriding member: 
//	'Autofac.Integration.WebApi.AutofacWebApiDependencyResolver.BeginScope()'. Security accessibility of the overriding method must match the security accessibility of the method being overriden.
// If this error is fixed, these two files can be removed and a dependency on Autofac.Integration.WebApi can be used instead.
